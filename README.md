## Deep Dive into Continuous Delivery of Microservices on AWS

This project is intended to provide information related with some of the following topics. The goal is to enable developers play with continuous delivery of Microservices on cloud platforms such as AWS. Those planning to do startups could get tips and code aamples to get started with development, testing and releasing (continuously deploying) the software thereby gaining the competitive edge for their products.


The project would demonstrate aome of the following:

1. Developers check-in the code into the code repository such as GitLab. 
2. GitLab webhook triggers the Jenkins job 
3. Jenkins job starts with getting code from repository, build the code, run the unit tests/integration 
4. Once build and tests run successfully, Jenkins build the image for Microservices and push the same to either of Dockerhub or AWS ECR.
5. After the docker image for microservices is pushed to the image repository, following is done to deploy microservices (woukd run within containers) on AWS ECS Cluster or AWS Elastic Beanstalk.
```markdown
1. Setup Gitlab and Jenkins (relevant plugins)
2. Setup Dockerhub, AWS ECR
3. Setup AWS ECS 
4. Setup AWS Elastic Beanstalk 
5. Configure Jenkins post-steps for deployment to AWS ECS
6. Confifure Jenkins post-steps for deployment to AWS Elastic Beanstalk
```
### Setup Gitlab and Jenkins


The first step is to get setup with the development envitonment  y which would

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/eajitesh/cloud-native-aws-demo/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
